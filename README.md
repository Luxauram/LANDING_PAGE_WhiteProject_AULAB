# AULAB - WHITE PROJECT

I've studied for my very very very first Web Dev experience in Aulab - Italy.

This was one of the projects they gave us to understand better CSS and Bootstrap.

Furthermore they gave us these indications to follow:

`Color:` rgb(6, 57, 108)

`Font:` Electrolize, Lato

(Images: If you see different images on my project is because they didn't gave us all the images that we needed for the project.)

And than a `"mockup"` of the "outstanding website" to build, here:
